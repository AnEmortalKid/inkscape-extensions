# inkscape-extensions

This repo holds some inkscape extensions I've made.

The extension tutorials are nice, but you'll sometimes have to inspect how other extensions do things to learn.

Here's where you can find them [extensions](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/extensions/-/tree/master) , you'll need a GitLab account.

I'll try to have a section on what each extension does and what references I used to figure it out

## batch_png_export

This extension exports PNGs in many square sizes (16x16, 32x32) etc, from the current document. It was built to produce [icons](https://www.foundations.unity.com/fundamentals/iconography#Single-Size-Icons) for the Unity Editor.
